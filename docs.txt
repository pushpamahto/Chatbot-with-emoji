🔍 Research Summary: How Chatbots Work
Today, I researched how chatbots function by visiting multiple websites. Based on my findings, chatbots can be developed in two ways:

✅ 1. With Code (Custom Chatbot):
Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript (often with frameworks like React).

Backend logic with Node.js, Python, etc.

Gives full control over UI/UX and features.

Can integrate APIs (like OpenAI, Dialogflow).

✅ 2. Without Code (No-code Platforms):
Tools like Tidio, ManyChat, Chatfuel.

Drag-and-drop flows.

Easy integration into websites via embed scripts.

Limited customization but quicker setup.




💡 Core Features a Chatbot Should Have:
Text-based communication

Emoji support

File attachment (images/docs)

Typing indicator (thinking dots)

Bot and user avatars

Send button & input box

Scroll/chat history

Responsive & styled layout











🧪 Today’s Implementation Work:
✅ Chatbot UI Created With HTML + CSS:
Header with bot logo and name.

Message area with scrollable chat history.

Message input with styling.

Custom fonts added: Inter, Raleway.

Thinking indicator with animation.

Send button appears only when input is valid.

Focus state styling for better UI/UX.

✅ Emoji Attachment Implementation (In Progress):
Tried implementing emoji picker and sending emojis.

Emoji not fully functional yet (sending part incomplete).

Plan: Add emoji button → open picker → append emoji to input field.

🧑‍🎨 CSS Styling Highlights:
Background gradient for better aesthetics.

Rounded borders and shadows for clean card layout.

Distinct colors for user and bot messages.

Hover effects for buttons.

📌 Next Steps:
Complete emoji send functionality.

Add file attachment support.

Integrate basic bot logic for replies.

Add responsiveness for smaller devices.

Refactor JavaScript (if any used) for message rendering.

 Final Note
I’m still working on completing full functionality. Meanwhile, I’ve learned a lot about how chatbots can be created both with and without code, how important UI is, and how to approach new features step-by-step.
